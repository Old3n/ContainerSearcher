# ContainerSearcher
## This is an unofficial personal update. For official support, please wait for the original creator.
Since the original creator of the mod [ContainerSearcher](https://modrinth.com/mod/csearcher) haven't updated the mod to 1.21.11 I decided to try and update the mod by myself. I reverse engineered the mod and with some help from AI I updated the mod to 1.21.11.
## Download 
[Download ContainerSearcher v0.3.5 for MC 1.21.11](https://github.com/Old3n/ContainerSearcher/releases/download/0.3.5forMc1.21.11/ContainerSearcher-0.3.5+Updated.for.mc1.21.11.jar)
## Installation 
Requires Fabric and Minecraft 1.21.11 and [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [FabricApi](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\
just place the jar file on the mods folder

# Disclaimer 
The files will be removed if the creator tells me to remove the files.\
If the mod doesn't get updated in the future i may keep updating the mod myself.
