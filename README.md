## This is an unofficial personal update. For official support, please wait for the original creator.
Since the original creator of the mod [ContainerSearcher](https://modrinth.com/mod/csearcher) hasn'tupdated the mod to 1.21.11 I decided to try and update the mod by myself. I reverse engineered the mod and with some help from AI I updated the mod to 1.21.11.
## Download 
[Download ContainerSearcher v0.3.5 for MC 1.21.11]()

just place the jar file in the mods folder.\

# Disclaimer 
The repo will be archived if the creator tells me to .\
If the mod doesn't get updated in the future i may keep updating the mod myself.
