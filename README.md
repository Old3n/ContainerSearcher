## This is an unofficial personal update. For official support, please wait for the original creator.
Since the original creator of the mod [ContainerSearcher](https://modrinth.com/mod/csearcher) hasn'tupdated the mod to 1.21.11 I decided to try and update the mod by myself. I reverse engineered the mod and with some help from AI I updated the mod to 1.21.11.
